## üß© Task Summary

The Nautilus application development team wanted to **clean the Git commit history** of the `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games` repository.
They required the repository to retain **only two commits**:

1. `initial commit`
2. `add data.txt file`

All other commits and changes needed to be removed, and the changes pushed to the remote repository.

## üß∞ Steps Performed

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Navigated to Repository

```bash
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Verified Commit History

Checked the existing commit log before resetting:

```bash
sudo git log --oneline
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Identified Target Commit

Located the commit with message:

```
add data.txt file
```

Commit hash: `1d4d12c`

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Reset Repository to Target Commit

Performed a **hard reset** to revert the working tree and branch pointer:

```bash
sudo git reset --hard 1d4d12c
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
HEAD is now at 1d4d12c add data.txt file
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Verified Post-Reset History

Confirmed that only the two required commits remain:

```bash
sudo git log --oneline
```

Output:

```
1d4d12c (HEAD -> master) add data.txt file
6e08add initial commit
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Force Pushed to Remote Repository

To sync local history with the remote:

```bash
sudo git push origin master --force
```

---

## üßæ Final Verification

Confirmed the remote branch now reflects the same two commits:

```bash
sudo git log --oneline origin/master
```

‚úÖ Remote matches local:

```
1d4d12c add data.txt file
6e08add initial commit
```
