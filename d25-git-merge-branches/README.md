# Git Branching and Merging Task Report

## Task Description

The Nautilus application development team requested updates to the Git repository `/opt/cluster.git`. The requirements were:

1. Create a new branch `nautilus` in `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster` repo from the `master` branch.
2. Copy the `/tmp/index.html` file into the repository.
3. Add and commit this file to the `nautilus` branch.
4. Merge the `nautilus` branch back into the `master` branch.
5. Push the changes to the origin for both branches.
