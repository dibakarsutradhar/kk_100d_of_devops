## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed

### 1. Install and Configure Apache

```bash
sudo yum install -y httpd
sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

* Changed `Listen 80` ‚Üí `Listen 8086` to serve Apache on port **8086**.

### 2. Deploy Website Files

Moved the site backups into Apache‚Äôs document root:

```bash
sudo mv /tmp/media /var/www/html/
sudo mv /tmp/demo /var/www/html/
```

### 3. Enable and Restart Apache

```bash
sudo systemctl enable httpd
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

<h1>KodeKloud</h1>
<p>This is a sample page for our media website</p>
</body>
</html>
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:8086/demo/
