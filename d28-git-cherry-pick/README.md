# Git Cherry-Pick Report â€“ Nautilus Project

## ðŸ“Œ Task Summary

The Nautilus development team requested that a specific commit with the message **`Update info.txt`** from the `feature` branch be merged into the `master` branch of the repository located at:

* Bare repo: `/opt/apps.git`
* Clone: `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps`

The developerâ€™s ongoing work in the `feature` branch was not ready to be fully merged, so only the single commit had to be transferred.

   ```

3. **Checked the `feature` branch for target commit**

   git checkout feature
   git log --oneline | grep "Update info.txt"
